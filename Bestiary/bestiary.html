                    <h2>Snared Flea</h2>
                    <h3>Health: 3 Shovel Hits | Danger Level: 30%</h3>
                    <p>Fleas in the "Snare" variety dangle from overhead surfaces and descend upon detecting nearby movement from a player. Their aim is to affix themselves to the player's head, seeking to hinder their breathing and potentially cause suffocation.</p>

                    <p>They display a high level of aggression and territorial behavior, roaming throughout the facility and strategically weaving webs to ensnare potential prey. If a player comes into contact with one of these webs, the creature becomes alerted and actively pursues the respective player.</p>

                    <p>Silently, they track players with the intent of swiftly breaking their necks and carrying off their bodies. Brief eye contact deters them, but extended gaze provokes their aggression.</p>

                    <p>These masks are often discovered in deserted locations, initially appearing as seemingly harmless pieces of scrap. However, employees who hold the masks to their faces for an extended duration will don the mask and succumb to its control, transforming into a Masked. The Masked individuals then pursue other employees, capturing and converting them into more Masked entities.</p>
