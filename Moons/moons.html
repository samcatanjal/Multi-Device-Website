                    <h2>41 Experimentation</h2>
                    <h3>Easy</h3>
                    <p>Experimentation is a deserted lunar landscape that has undergone industrialization. It is characterized by rugged terrains and lifeless soil, scattered with remnants of old machinery and deteriorating structures throughout the area.</p>

                    <h2>220 Assurance</h2>
                    <h3>Easy</h3>
                    <p>Assurance is a moon with a desert-like environment, featuring steep hills and massive rocks. Similar to Experimentation and Offense, discarded machinery is strewn across the landscape, suggesting the past existence of some industrial activity on this celestial body.</p>

                    <h2>56 Vow</h2>
                    <h3>Easy</h3>
                    <p>Vow's terrain encompasses an expansive forest with hills and abundant trees. The location where the spacecraft touches down seems to be a raised platform enclosed by a deep trench.</p>

                    <h2>21 Offense</h2>
                    <h3>Intermediate</h3>
                    <p>Offense bears many resemblances to Assurance. It boasts a more expansive map with an increased presence of scattered machinery, possibly suggesting a thriving industry in the moon's past. However, the nature of the industry thriving in such a harsh environment remains uncertain.</p>

                    <h2>61 March</h2>
                    <h3>Intermediate</h3>
                    <p>Similar to Vow, March features a rich forest landscape. It does not experience rainy weather but is instead consistently under rainfall, likely attributed to its moisture-saturated atmosphere. March's topography is predominantly hilly, with numerous trees scattered across the map..</p>

                    <h2>85 Rend</h2>
                    <h3>Hard</h3>
                    <p>Among the three moons requiring payment, Rend stands as the initial one in the sequence. It is consistently covered in a blizzard, and unlike its snowy-moon counterpart, Dine, it is resistant to flooding.</p>

                <div class="moon">
                    <h2>7 Dine</h2>
                    <h3>Hard</h3>
                    <p>The persistent blizzard severely limits visibility, making it challenging to see over long distances. Utilizing the lamp posts as a guide to the entrance can prove highly beneficial in such conditions. Additionally, the snowstorm dampens sound, making communication difficult over larger distances.</p>

                <div class="moon">
                    <h2>8 Titan</h2>
                    <h3>Hard</h3>
                    <p>It stands out as the most challenging yet highly profitable moon. Thanks to its ability to generate numerous scrap parts and its extensive loot table, this moon is particularly favored by employees willing to take risks in exchange for its bountiful rewards.</p>
